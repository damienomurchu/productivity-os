# Productivity OS üß†‚öôÔ∏è

Welcome to my second brain ‚Äî the place where tools, tips, scripts, and systems collide to make me faster, sharper, and slightly less annoyed at life.

This repo is my personal productivity and tooling knowledge base. It's where I store all the utilities, automation hacks, mental models, and workflows that keep the chaos (mostly) under control.
